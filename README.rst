cookiecutter-github-repo
========================

An experimental Cookiecutter that:

1. Generates a bare-bones GitHub project.
2. Sticks the project into a GitHub repo.

Still experimental. Don't use or consider this an example. This will change!

Specifically, this functionality will be extracted into a Cookiecutter plugin.
